### ***Limberg, Daniel & Mueller, Lukas***

In this repository we provide our Final Paper and Website for the Collaborative Social Science Class at the HSoG in the Spring of 2016.

We provide all information that is needed to reproduce our work: The relevant Code through **R-scripts** and the **Rmarkdown-file**. And the data in .csv documents, the final **.pdf-file**. We provide two folders with the current Code and Data 

This final assignment includes three requirements: *"The first is a oral presentation (10 minute maximum) given in the final class. The second is a standard academic paper (5,000 words maximum) that is fully reproducible and dynamically generated. The third is a website designed to present key aspects of your research in an engaging way to a general audience."*
