#GDP Growth and National Stock Market Indices
### ***Limberg, Daniel & Mueller, Lukas***

In this repository we provide our final paper and website for the Collaborative Social Science Class at the HSoG in the Spring of 2016.

We raise the question, whether national GDP growth is detached from changes in national stock market indices. Using data from the OECD, ECB and Yahoo Finance we focus on four open economies: France, Japan, Germany and Great Britain. 

We provide all information that is needed to reproduce our work and final website/paper: The relevant code through R-scripts (**FinalPaper_Code**) and all data used in .csv format **FinalPaper_Data**).
