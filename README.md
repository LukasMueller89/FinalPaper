### Instructions and Background

We aim to answer the question, whether national GDP growth is detached from changes in national stock market indices. Using data from the OECD, ECB and Yahoo Finance we focus on four open economies: France, Japan, Germany and Great Britain. 

We provide all information that is needed to reproduce our work and final website/paper: The relevant code through R-scripts (**FinalPaper_Code**) and all data used in .csv format (**FinalPaper_Data**). We provide two BibTeX files: One for the R-packages we used. The other one including all literature that we used for our paper.
