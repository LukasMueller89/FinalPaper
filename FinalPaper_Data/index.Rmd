# Introduction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, equity prices have become the nexus between capitalism and our daily life on the globe. Especially the financial crisis and the following European sovereign debt crisis darken the beauty of this nexus, that was once proclaimed to be a good - if not the best - example of a functioning market mechanism.\newline
On this project page we present the results of our study in a nutshell: What is the key background for our research and what are our key assumptions and findings?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We investigate an odd relation that is a part of the nexus: GDP growth and a subset of national equity prices; that is national stock indices. The intuitive assumption that one automatically has is fairly straight forward: The better the economy performs, the higher expectations of market participants, investments and trust in the future. In turn, we should - naturally - obtain an increase in the *level* of a national stock market indices given good economic performance within a country. However, the more interesting question is beyond this intuitive assumption:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focus on four OECD countries: **France**, **Germany**, **Great Britain** and **Japan**. And we investigate whether GDP growth has an effect of the *changes* of the indices. If so, are there different levels of statistical significance for the effect of GDP growth across the different countries? That is, we do not compare the size of the effects (i.e. coefficients) since we investigate on different dependent variables. We take the four major national stock market indices of the countries as our dependent variable: The CAC40 (France), DAX (Germany), FTSE100 (Great Britain) and the NIKKEI (Japan). We control for a row of other, lagged explanatory determinants - not only from within the national economy (e.g. inflation rate) but also external, more global factors (e.g. oil price). We elaborate on the specific covariates below. For our analysis we focus on the time period between the beginning of 1999 (where ECB interest rates became relevant) and the end of 2015.

# What Others Found
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, we are not the first ones to come up with the idea, that it might be interesting to have a closer look at the relationship of GDP growth and (national) stock market indices. So in the following, let us very briefly summarize what scolars found out about the topic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field provides various studies which focus on the relationship between GDP growth (or macroeconomic determinants of GDP growth) and stock markets in general. For example, Claessens et al. "study how local stock market development and internationalization listing, trading, and capital raising in international exchanges are related to economic fundamentals" [@claessens2006stock]. Duca states that there is a clear co-movement between stock market prices and GDP in developed economies. Assuming causal effects he finds that "the level of economic activity in a country can potentially depend on the stock market amongst other variables" [@duca2007relationship]. On the other hand, Ritter finds that cross-country correlation of real stock returns and per capita GDP growth over 1900-2002 is negative. This is mainly traced back to the fact that increases in capital and labor inputs (i.e. two main determinants of GDP growth) in new corporations (i.e. representing innovation) do not necessarily imply higher dividends [@ritter2005economic].
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 42 emerging markets Yartey examines the effect of institutional and macroeconomic determinants on stock market developments [@yartey2008determinants]. Similar studies focus on these determinants for a wide range of countries. These include OECD countries like Belgium [@van2006stock], France [@sraer2007performance], Germany [@antonios2010stock] or New Zealand from 1990 to 2003 [@diebold2008macroeconomic]. And developing markets such as Malaysia [@rahman2009macroeconomic] or BRICS-countries like India [@singh2010causal, @agrawalla2007causality] and South Africa [@hsing2011stock] in general. 

# What We Aimed to Find
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having outlined what the field has already done, let us now turn to our own Research Question and Hypothesis. They read as follows.

*Do changes in GDP growth lead to changes in the country's national stock market index?*

* H~0~: There are statistically significant effects of GDP growth on the growth rates of a country's stock market index.

* H~1~: There are no statistically significant effects of GDP growth on the growth rates of a country's stock market index.

# Variables of Interest 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following we introduce our variables of interest and briefly summarize how they fit our purpose. All variables were collected on (or aggregated to) a quarterly format.  
<br>
We derive all our data from the [ECB database](http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu),
[Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/market-overview/?bypass=true) and the [OECD database](http://stats.oecd.org).

| **Variables**       | Number | Origin of Data | Time Range               |
|---------------------|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Dependent Variables | 4      | Yahoo Finance  | Quarter 1 1999 - Q4 2015 |
| Covariates          | 6      | ECB, OECD      | Quarter 1 1999 - Q4 2015 |

## Dependent Variables
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use data from Yahoo Finance to derive four dependent variables. We are interested in equity prices in the form of national stock market indices for four OECD countries: France, Germany, Great Britain and Japan. The indices measure the combined stock values of companies and/or equities in a country which are top performing according to given benchmarks. We measure the dependent variables as the change of the average closing value from the previous quarter. In other words, we are not interested in the *level* but rather in the *variation* or *changes* of the indices over time.

**Dependent Variables**   | Official Title                      | Scope
 ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------
 CAC40 (France) | Cotation Assisté en Continu 40 | 40 highest Market Caps
 DAX (Germany) | Deutscher Aktienindex | 30 major Companies
 FTSE100 (Great Britain) | Fin. Times Stock Exchange 100 Index | 100 Companies
 NIKKEI (Japan) | NIKKEI 225 | 225 Equities

## Covariates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our paper we control for various covariates. We use a lag of one quarter and another lag of two quarters for all covariates. If not indicated differently, the default for the covariates is a lag of one quarter.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the control variables we differentiate between country-specific and general covariates that apply to all countries. Starting with country-specific covariates (i.e. variables that are unique to France, Germany, Great Britain and France), we use OECD data to derive the three following covariates. Among them is our key independent variable: GDP growth. We also use private consumption and the inflation rate (measured through the CPI) within the countries as additional control variables. 

| **Country-specific Covariates** | Measured                  |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| GDP growth                      | % change to previous quarter |
| Consumer price index (CPI)      | % change to previous quarter | 
| Private consumption             | % change of share of GDP to prev. quarter |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ECB database we use the deposit facility (i.e. interest rate for banks^[We rakishly use the term "banks" for this paper. While "Financial Institutions" would be more appropriate to apply, we dare to continue with "banks" for reasons of simplicity.] making overnight deposits with the Eurosystem). Quite noticeable is the fact that, since June 2014, the rate is negative. That is, quite counter-intuitive, banks are penalized when making deposits.\newline
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again using OECD data, we also take the quarterly GDP growth rate of the USA as a proxy for the general development of the world economy. The economy of the USA has a profound impact on other national business cycles, and national recessions in the US have sever repercussions across the globe. This was demonstrated again after 2007 when the US subprime mortgage crisis turned into a global recession. Moreover, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price changes are taken as an indicator of global economic health and a crucial determinant of economic growth.

| **Covariates**        | Measured                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ECB deposit facility  | % change to previous quarter             |
| GDP growth USA        | % change to previous quarter             |
| WTI                   | % change to previous quarter             |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the early stage of research for this paper other covariates were taken into account: the ECB's interest rate on the main refinancing operations (MRO), the unemployment rate for the four countries of interest and the brent crude oil price. However, a first variance inflation factor (vif) test after prelimenary regressions suggested to ignore the mentioned variables.

# Some Overviews
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going into some of our results let us describe what we can already see and understand without actually going into more sophisticated analysis. We shall start with our dependent variables, then have a closer look into our key independent variables and finally look how they correlate.

## Dependent Variables
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below we present a first interactive overview of the four dependent variables: The % change of the average closing value of the indices to the previous quarter. The graphs range from the first quarter in 1999 to the last quarter in 2015. Given the financial crisis, the CAC40, DAX, FTSE100 and NIKKEI share a remarkable but unsurprising downturn in the end of 2008 and in early 2009.

## Independent Variables
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting overview is given below. Here, we summarize the developments of our key independent variables over Q1 1999 until Q4 2015. Our country-specific, key independent variables measure GDP growth (i.e. change to previous quarter) for the country in question. Remarkable again is the major, well visible downturn during and in the aftermath of financial crisis in all four graphs.

```

multiplot(p7, p5, p8, p6, cols = 2)
```

### Joint Distributions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below, we present the joint distributions between our dependent and key independent variables for the four countries in four interactive graphs. Here, we use GDP growth lagged by one quarter, which we also use in the following analysis section below. The key dependent variables on the y-axes are the % changes of average closing values for the given indices.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remarkable are the few outliers in negative GDP growth for Germany, France, and Japan, which suggest a downward trend. However, the confindence intervals already indicate that one needs to be careful with drawing conclusions from this section of the graphics. More interesting is the general upward trend for Germany, Japan, and Great Britain that starts around and above a GDP growth of 0%. This supports the original idea we described earlier on: A well performing national economy should, in theory, lead to a rise in the national stock market index. Quite to the contrary, we see rather a stagnation instead of a rise around and above a GDP growth of 0% for Japan. While we need regression modeling to draw true conclusions from this correlation, it should also be mentioned again that the NIKKEI combines the highest number of equities of all dependent variables. It is probably fair to assume that the high number of equities balances the relationship.

# What We Found
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let us have a look into what we have found so far. Results indicate that the rate of GDP growth three month ago has somehwat of a predicitve vlaue when determining the performance of the national stock index. The numbers show that one percent GDP growht over a quater leads to roughly 8 percent increase in the average quaterly closign value of the CAC40. This relationship holds true for all other stock indices - a growing economy leads to better performing national stock indices. Whereas we can say that this relationship exists in the data for France, we cannot rely on the analysis with the same confidence for Germany, Great Britain, and especially Japan. For these countries the effect might as well not be different from zero.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the quarterly change of the European Central Bank's deposit facility the coefficient suggests that the more the interest rate increases the lower the performance of a national stock market index. In other terms, the negative effect suggests that when the deposit facility interest increases, banks' revenues increase when storing their money overnight at the ECB. This implies that a high interest rate incentives the banks to keep money off markets. The negative effect suggests that increasing volumes of money held at banks does hurt the stock market: Less liquidity dampens investments. It seems straightforward that this effect is only weakly significant for Japan since Japanese banks are not directly affected by changes of the deposit facility. Moreover, the effect becomes statistical insignificance, when lagged by one period, can be explained by the outside lag of the political decision making process. Such decisions need at least six months to have an actual effect on the economy. The effects of a change in the central bank's monetary policy on an individual may not become visible before a certain time has passed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final model does explain a relatively large portion of the variance in the dependent variable. When looking at the Adjusted R2 which is lowest for Germany with Adj.-R2=.36 and highest for France with Adj.-R2=.53 it should be noted, however, that a direct comparison is difficult to make. The four dependent variables are all differently composed, and thus, variables measuring the same concept may have a different effect across the four regression models.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the results suggest to not reject the Null that there are statistically significant effects of GDP growth on the growth rates of a country's stock index for France. For all other national stock indices we cannot accept the Null and have to conclude that there are no statistically significant effects of GDP growth on the growth rates of a country's stock market index.\newline

# Limitations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis is subject to certain limitations.^[Diagnostics results can be found in the Appendix] All tests are done for each regression separately. First, it should be noted that one has to take results with caution: if GDP of an economy and stock market performance of its best firms and equities are intertwined then the regression model estimates suffer from reverse causality. The analysis tries to mitigate this endogeneity problem by introducing two lags for GDP growth and each other variable. However, if the reverse causality is too strong and both variables would effectively measure the same concept, then the lag is the only variance in the regression. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, a Breusch-Pagan test suggests that the analysis suffers from heteroskedasticity. We cannot accept the null and thus, have to assume that the variance of the residuals is dependent on the values of the changes in stock indices which renders coefficients inconsistent. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the analysis employs a Breusch-Godfrey test to look for serial autocorrelation. The test does indicate that we can accept the null and thus, can assume no serial autocorrelation is present in the data. Consequently, we assume that the standard errors are not underestimated. Since we deal with a time series we conclude that there is an acceptable degree of heteroskedasticity. The result of the Breusch-Pagan test might not be as reliable in the presence of lagged dependent variables. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the external validity of the results must be seen with utmost caution. We have only looked at four national stock indices which are all composed differently and measure stock performances in industrial nations of the OECD. In summary, we can conclude that the coefficients statistical significance is reliable to a certain degree since standard errors are assumed to be efficient. However, internal validity is harmed by the small sample size. Concerning external validity, results should only be taken as indicative and not as final conclusive evidence since they rely on OECD countries only.

# Future Research
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future Research could further invest into interactions: Is the true effect of GDP growth on changes of national stock market indices dependent on a second covariate? Also interesting should be approaches that aim for a higher external validity than we did: Studies could include national indices of other OECD countries or re-focus solely on BRICS or developing countries.Another pathway for future research could be to stay closer to the format of the original raw data: While we collapsed and aggregated data to quarterly format, analysis with monthly, weekly or even daily data should yield some interesting results. Especially, since we found that the effects of changes in GDP growth on the changes of national stock market indices are of rather immediate than long-term nature. 
 
# Conclusion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this website, we summarized the main findings of our underlying research paper. We used economic data from Germany, Japan, Great Britain and France to provide an analysis of the effect of national GDP Growth on changes of national stock market indices. Key findings indicated that the role of banks as intermediaries on the market can potentially explain whether there is a relationship between GDP growth and stock index growth. Controling for various covariates the paper found that for France GDP growth had statistically significant effects on the CAC40. Germany and Japan did so to a lesser extent, and Great Britain with a capital based financial market did not observe a statsistically significant effect.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the negative coefficient for the change in the deposit facility of the ECB suggested a ststistical significant relationship for all countries except Japan. This was in line with the intuition. It could have been expected that the coefficient is not significant for Japan, since it is much more tied up with the Asian economy. All other coeffcients are not statistical significant. First, this indicates that different financial market strucutres play a role in how people invest their money. Whereas in Great Britain banks do not play such a huge role as intermediaries on the market, they do so in France, Germany, and Japan. The paper argues that people on theses different markets have a different propensity to safe. Put differently, in Great Britain people are much more likely to invest. Second, these findings support the notion that the financial markets are disconnected from the producing sector to a certain degree and do no longer reflect real economic growth.
